Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

I learned to use Flexbox to align the contents of this project which was a very convient tool that I need to continue improving myself in to improve my styling.

Working on this project helped me in developed some skill in problem solving were I had to go back and forth to find what I did wrong and it made me realize how important it was to check that there's no missing or unnecessary quotaion marks or parantheses
