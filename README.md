## My process

### Built with

- non-Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use Flexbox to align the contents of this project which was a very convient tool that I need to continue improving myself in to improve my styling.

Working on this project helped me in developed some skill in problem solving were I had to go back and forth to find what I did wrong and it made me realize how important it was to check that there's no missing or unnecessary quotaion marks or parantheses
